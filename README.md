# Raspberry Pi with 4G network

I wanted to DIY a phone number that can automatically reply to phone calls and receive / send SMS.
Initially I thought I could do it with a mobile phone. However I realized that the APIs of the Android and
iOS do not support this very well. So I decided to do this with Raspberry Pi and a 4G module.

The 4G module I used is SIM7600CE.
